    <h2>This Asian Chicken Salad is crispy, fresh, and loaded with BIG tastes! Shredded slaw, carrots, edamame, crispy chow mein noodles, and soy-marinated chicken on top. YUM!</h2>
    
    <p> 
        Super satisfyingly crispy cabbage/slaw/lettuce/ shredded Brussels (if you expensive), intense crisp carrots and almonds, and the impressive mouthwatering crunch of chow mein noodles. All the very best chomping!
        And After That there's the juicy marinaded chicken instilled with ginger, garlic, garam masala, and soy sauce.

    <p>
        Sprinkle your preferred Asain-inspired dressing of option and you stay in business. (We like Paneras, do not seethe!). SO. MUCH. TASTE.
        And while not a standard salad of any real Asian origin however rather more than likely born someplace in the 50s/60s in California (according to Wiki), it does utilize great deals of tastes and active ingredients motivated by pan-Asian food. Generally, this is among those menu favorites you see once again and once again that we simply can not get enough of.
