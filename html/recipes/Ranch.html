    <h1>Ranch Chicken Tacos</h1>
    <img src="../../Images\Ranch.jpeg" alt="Ranch Chicken Tacos">
    <h2>A great change from regular Mexican style tacos. A cool summer dinner, made quick with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred it for real tacos.</h2>

        VERY VERY GOOD! My new favorite taco! The only thing I did different was to pan cook a few chicken breast with some taco seasoning on them and shred them up. 
        The rest was the same! I LOVE these and will be making them often! They are also great for not having to use the oven in this Texas Summer Heat!
